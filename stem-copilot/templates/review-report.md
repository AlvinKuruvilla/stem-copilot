## Critical Findings

<!-- List findings that could invalidate the main result or a key lemma. -->
<!-- Remove this section if no critical findings survive all 5 passes. -->

1. **[Finding title]** — Confidence: [High | Medium | Low]

   - **Issue**: [Precise description of the error or gap]
   - **Derivation**: [Step-by-step verification showing the issue]
   - **Impact**: [Does this invalidate the main result? A lemma? Is it fixable?]
   - [GAP: specific unproven assumption or missing step, if applicable]
   - **Action**: [What the author should do to address this]
